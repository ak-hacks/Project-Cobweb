Project-Cobweb @ Pan-Pearson Hackathon
======================================

Introduction
------------

Were building an interlinked web of Companies and People. 
The hack will involve mashup of Companies and Directors data API with FT Content Search API. This will expose the data in a much more visual and discoverable way. Currently, this data is presented in plain old tabular format which doesn't facilitate data and relationship discovery.
